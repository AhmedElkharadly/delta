Project Description:

The goal of this project is to create a web-based asset management system that allows the company to store and manage its stock of assets, categories and locations. The system should be easy to use and should provide the company with the ability to view, add, edit, delete and search for assets. 

The system should have the following features: 
•	User authentication system – users must be able to log in with a unique username and password. 
•	Asset management – users should be able to add, edit, delete and view assets. 
•	Category management – users should be able to add, edit, delete and view categories. 
•	Location management – users should be able to add, edit, delete and view locations. 
•	Search functionality – users should be able to search for assets by category or location. 
•	Reporting functionality – users should be able to generate reports on asset inventory levels by category or location. 


My Approach: 
I will create a web-based asset management system using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end development and PHP/MySQL for the back-end development. I will create a user authentication system that allows users to log in with a unique username and password. For asset management, I will create forms that allow users to add, edit, delete and view assets. For category management I will create forms that allow users to add, edit, delete and view categories. For location management I will create forms that allow users to add, edit, delete and view locations. For search functionality I will create a search bar where users can search for assets by category or location. Lastly I will create reporting functionality which allows users to generate reports on asset inventory levels by category or location.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
